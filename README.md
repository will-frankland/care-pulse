## About this app

CarePulse is a mock medical site that allows patients to sign-up, enter medical and ID information and book appointments with their doctor/s. It also contains an admin panel protected by a passkey that allows admin users to visit a dashboard to schedule, cancel or edit requested appointments.

It was built using NextJs, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Appwrite, ShadCN, and Sentry.

Sentry was installed to monitor for errors and bugs and will immediately send a report to the site administrator with full details of any occuring error including a video - the great thing about this is that all details are blocked out to comply with security and in this case hippocratic regulations.

Appwrite was used for the database and storage of documents.


### Functionality & Key Features

The site is fully adjustable for screen sizes ranging from mobile to desktop.

I followed a tutorial created by JavaScriptMastery to become more proficient with TypeScript and NextJs, learn more key principles and best practices in order to expand my portfolio.

CarePulse has been deployed on Vercel and can be viewed here:
